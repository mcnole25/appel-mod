# What is Appel?

If you're a Scratch user, you may have heard of Appel. I do not own the game, griffpatch does. It's about a yellow player exploring 9 levels, jumping on enemies, collecting apples.

# Why didn't you remix it on Scratch?

There are 2 reasons. First of all, the game has over 12000 blocks, and might prevent me from saving the project. Second, the mod sprite uses Turbowarp exclusive blocks, so it can't be uploaded to Scratch anyway.
